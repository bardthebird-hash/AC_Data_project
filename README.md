# AC_Data_project
A Data Science project using Assetto Corsa's Data Pipeline for a multiclass short race sprint

This project uses Python and the Motorsport Racing Simulator "Assetto Corsa" for its physics engine and easy to use data pipeline, to create a diagnostic on how Tire Wear and Fuel load affect lap times. This was a 10 lap race with 2014-2016 World Endurance Championship LMP1 and GT3 Cars as in the: Nissan GT-R GT3, Audi R8 LMS 2016, Porche 919 Hybrid 2015 and 2016, and the car used in the data, the Audi R18 e-tron quattro 2014, which will be refered to as the "Primary Car." This simulation was done on the Zandvoort track in the Netherlands with clear weather. The Primary Car was running a full fuel load, 54 Litres, and was running with Medium Tires.
