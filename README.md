# AC_Data_project
This project uses Python and the Assetto Corsa physics engine to build a custom data pipeline. The goal is to generate diagnostics and diagrams quantifying how variables like tire degradation, fuel weight, and traffic interaction affect performance in a multiclass racing environment.
🏎️ The Multiclass Environment

This study is modeled after WEC/IMSA (Multiclass) racing, featuring two distinct vehicle tiers:

    Prototypes (LMP1): Highly technical, high-downforce, and hybrid-powered machines (e.g., Audi R18).

    GT3: Slower, production-based vehicles that represent the bridge between road cars and pure race cars.

Vehicle Roster: Derived from the Assetto Corsa Ultimate Edition (2014-2016 spec LMP1 and GT3).
