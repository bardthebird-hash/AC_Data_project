# AC_Data_project
A Data Science project using Assetto Corsa's Data Pipeline for a multiclass short race sprint

This project uses Python and the Motorsport Racing Simulator "Assetto Corsa" for its physics engine and easy to use data pipeline, to create diagnostics and diagrams on how different variables in racing affect lap times, speed, etc. This is based apon the WEC/IMSA or "Multiclass racing" design, where you have 2 types of cars, a "Prototype" car, which is more technical and faster, and a "GT3" car which is slower, and is based apon a real road car. This project uses the Cars available with the Ultimate edition of Assetto Corsa, which is 2014-2016 LMP1 and GT3 cars.
